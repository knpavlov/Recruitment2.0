# Authentication and email delivery setup

This guide summarizes the configuration steps required to make the invitation-based login flow work end to end.

## 1. Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL database configured via `DATABASE_URL` (or the individual `PG*` variables).
- Backend deployed and reachable over HTTPS.
- Frontend deployed on the public domain that users will access (for example, `https://app.nboard.au`).
- A verified sender in Resend that matches your custom domain (for example, `login@nboard.au`).

## 2. Backend environment variables

Provide the following variables in the backend service (for example, inside Railway â†’ Environment):

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@nboard.au
RESEND_API_KEY=re_********************************
RESEND_FROM=Recruitment 2.0 <login@nboard.au>
INVITE_URL=https://app.nboard.au/login
```

Notes:

- `RESEND_API_KEY` must come from the Resend dashboard (`API Keys` section).
- `RESEND_FROM` must use a sender address that is verified under the same domain inside Resend.
- `INVITE_URL` should point to the login screen; query parameters for the email and invitation token are appended automatically.
- `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` controls which address receives the seed super admin account during migrations.

If you ever prefer SMTP over Resend, replace the `RESEND_*` variables with the `SMTP_*` variables described in the root `README.md`.

## 3. Frontend environment variables

Set the API base URL for the frontend build so the SPA can call the backend:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URL=https://api.nboard.au
```

Adjust the value to the real backend origin. When both services are deployed on Railway you can keep relying on automatic host derivation; for custom domains the explicit variable avoids mixed-content issues.

## 4. DNS and domain checklist

1. Point the desired subdomain (for example, `app.nboard.au`) to your frontend hosting provider.
2. Point another subdomain (for example, `api.nboard.au`) to the backend hosting provider.
3. In your DNS zone add the Resend verification records: DKIM (`resend._domainkey`), SPF (`send` TXT), and MX (`feedback-smtp.ap-northeast-1.amazonses.com`).
4. (Recommended) Add a DMARC TXT record such as `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:postmaster@nboard.au`.

Wait for DNS propagation and confirm the domain status in the Resend dashboard.

## 5. End-to-end verification

1. **Restart** the backend after updating variables so the process picks up the new configuration.
2. Open the **Account management** screen as the super admin and invite a test email address.
3. Confirm that an **invitation email** arrives from `Recruitment 2.0 <login@nboard.au>` and that the link leads to your login page with the email pre-filled.
4. On the login page, submit the email to request a **one-time access code** and verify that the code arrives within a few seconds.
5. Enter the code, tick **Keep me signed in** if you want a long session, and ensure the dashboard opens with the correct role-based navigation.
6. Use the **Sign out** button in the sidebar and confirm you return to the login screen.

If any step fails, check the backend logs. When email delivery is misconfigured the API returns HTTP 503 with the error code `mailer-unavailable`, and the UI displays a dedicated message so you can fix the settings before retrying.
